ChasingCubes

This is my first Linux game. I'm not an expert developer, this is just an experiment.


THE CONCEPT

There was no concept. I just started to learn how SDL and OpenGL works. I tryed to draw a cube,
I tryed to move it with arrows, I tryed to draw several cubes. The last step was writing a 
simple artificial intelligence.

All advices and suggestions are welcome.
